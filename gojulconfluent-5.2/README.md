In order to make this build recipe work you must download a Confluent distribution, rename it into confluent-distrib.tgz and put it in this directory. Otherwise the program will attempt to download it by itself. These scripts have been tested against Confluent distribution 5.2. They're provided as-is, without any warranty, for the community.

NOTE : Confluent 5.2 requires RHEL 7 to work, it won't function on RHEL 6. Beware as well that Confluent 5.2 is no longer considered as open source, check https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq for further information.
