This package has been tested with Consul 1.0.6. If you want to use it with another release, just
download the ZIP you want from Hashicorp, rename it consul.zip and put it in this directory. Note
that it should not work with a release older than 1.0.1 due to the fact consul now requires the
specific .json extension for its configuration files.

Note that it contains work from https://github.com/hypoport/consul-rpm-rhel6/
