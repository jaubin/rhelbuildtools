This package has been tested with Consul 1.0.6. If you want to use it with another release, just
download the ZIP you want from Hashicorp, rename it consul.zip and put it in this directory. Note
that it should not work with a release older than 1.0.1 due to the fact consul now requires the
specific .json extension for its configuration files.

Note that it contains work from https://github.com/hypoport/consul-rpm-rhel6/.

It contains HashiCorp's Consul itself, which is released under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
Project source is available here : https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/

It also contains the (almost mandatory) Consul companion Consul Template, released under the terms
of the Mozilla Public License 2.0 as well. Project source is available here :
