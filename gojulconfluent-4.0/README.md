In order to make this build recipe work you must download a Confluent distribution, rename it into confluent-distrib.tgz and put it in this directory. Otherwise this program will attempt to download the Confluent distribution by itself. These scripts have been tested against Confluent distribution 4.0. They're provided as-is, without any warranty, for the community.
