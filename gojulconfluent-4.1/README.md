In order to make this build recipe work you must download a Confluent distribution, rename it into confluent-distrib.tgz and put it in this directory. Otherwise the program will attempt to download it by itself. These scripts have been tested against Confluent distribution 4.1. They're provided as-is, without any warranty, for the community.

NOTE : Confluent 4.1 requires RHEL 7 to work, it won't function on RHEL 6.
